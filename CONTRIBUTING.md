## How do I contribute to the js application

Clone the appjs repository in a separate folder
```
git clone https://github.com/cipherguard/cipherguard-appjs.git
```

In your cipherguard_api folder install the javascript dependencies
```
npm install
```

Link the source of cipherguard-appjs project to your cipherguard_api project
```
cd node_modules
rm -fr cipherguard-appjs
npm link ../../cipherguard-appjs
cd ../
```

Listen to any change on the cipherguard-appjs product
```
grunt appjs-watch
```

If you want to save the browser refresh operation, and you are aware about the security implication, you can
install browser-sync
