Cipherguard is pleased to announce the immediate availability of version v4.9.1.

Cipherguard v4.9.1 is a maintenance update that fixes issues reported by the community.
Among other fixes, this version addresses a compatibility issue with the PostgreSQL database, where users encountered
difficulties sharing passwords with users or groups when different cases were involved in their names.

Additionally, system administrator tools have been improved to better handle the purge of action logs on large datasets.

We would like to express our appreciation to the community for their assistance in improving Cipherguard!
